  <h1 id="overall" href="#">2. Overall Description </h1><br>
  <p>
    <h3>2.1 Product Perspective:</h3>
    <p>
      This product is a rental house management system called "BASABHARA.COM." It is a part of the software engineering course assessment at North South University's Spring academic semester of 2023. The faculty member proposed the project idea while acting as a "client" with the student group members who performed the tasks as an imaginary software firm. The product is a new self-contained system that is neither a member of a product family nor a replacement for another system.
    </p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h3>2.2 Product Functions:</h3>
    <p>
      

      The functionality of the product includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Using the rental house management system eliminates the need for a third party to rent a house.</li>
        <li>Users can search for houses in different areas and locations without traveling to the location.</li>
        <li>Direct communication between the householders and renters of the house.</li>
        <li>Clarifications can be done easily.</li>
        <li>Saves time for both parties.</li>
        <li>Multiple available houses and renters to choose from.</li>
        
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:</h3>
    <p>
      The users of the application can be classified into two types. The ones who want to give a house for rent (house owners) and the ones who want to rent a house. There is no strict distinction between the two types of users. Both users can access all the functionality of the application.
    </p>
    <p style="page-break-after:always"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h3>2.4 Operating Environment:</h3>
    <p>
      The software will operate on web apps and android devices. The operating environment should have access to a microphone for voice recording. It is recommended not to use any old Android OS version and use a relatively modern web browser.
    </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Contraints:</h3>
    <p>
      Constraints include:
      <ul>
        <li>The time allotted for this project is, at most, six months.</li>
        <li>The application's front end will be made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Python will be used as the language for the application's back-end, and PostgreSQL will be used for the application's database.</li>
        <li>The website will be in the English language. Users who do not know English will need help using the website.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>2.6 User Documentation:</h3>
    <p>
      The software comes with a user manual and a short video for non-technical individuals that explains "how to install and use the software."
    </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies:</h3>
    <p>
      The software assumes that the user's devices will have access to the internet that can connect to the internet, have a google account, can use a web app and android app, and have access to necessary devices to use those interfaces. It is also assumed that the user has access to a microphone that can record voices. This software relies on APIs such as Google OAuth API and external ML speech-to-text APIs, So the software's one of the core differentiators relies on the external ML model's performance, and it is assumed that the ML model's performances are reasonable. The project could be affected if these dependencies are incorrect, are not shared, or are changed.

  <h1 id="eir" href="#"> 3. External Interface Requirements </h1><br>
  <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
  <p>There will be two types of users. One is householders, and the other is renters. Both the user also has two interfaces. One is "Command by typing," and the other is "Command by voice." In the first interface, the user will provide the command by keyboard; in the second interface, the user will give the command by voice recording through the device's microphone. After that, the user must fill up a registration form with a live captured photograph. In the mobile application, users can take their photos through the mobile camera. In the web application, users also use the mobile's camera through a web link which is provided by the system. After registration, the householders can post their house information with their house photos, and the renters can search for houses. The renters can also search ads from other third-party rental house management systems through this application. To make the search process easy for the renters, they can use their mobile cameras to scan a house and get all the information about that house that the householders provided. Therefore, all the processes can also be done by voice command.</p>
  </ul><br>
  <h3>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
  <p>The primary hardware requirement for the system is a computer or a mobile phone. The system will require microphone permission to assign and give a voice command and an internet connection to call API.</p><br>
  <h3>3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
  <p>This system will use ORM to map relational cardinalities. It will use a Speech-to-text machine learning model API to detect questions and answers for the voice command. This system will also use Google OAuth 2.0 to log in or register to the app with google.</p><br>
  <h3>3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
  <p>The system will use Restful API to connect the front-end with the back-end. This system uses OAuth 2.0 by Google for verification and token authentication to communicate between the front-end and back-end through API.</p>

      <h3>5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
      <p>All circumstances will be covered by the system. It will operate nonstop for the entire calendar year. Software would be ready when promised, preventing any disruption from happening. The system's structure will be chosen in accordance with the requirements. The system's user interface (UI) will be simple and easy to understand so that users won't have any trouble identifying the functions. The software package should have flawless operation across its whole feature set.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
      <p>When software crashes by default, the requirement should be used so that we have another option that still preserves data on multiple servers. Make sure you abide by international laws and rules when managing the hotel system, and get certified to ensure all safety requirements are met.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure the safety and security of the product's data, the system must be registered with the security-providing company and should be approved by a genuine identity. To protect the data from market hackers, a high level of network security should be implemented. Any legitimate accredited network security business, such as Fire Eye, should certify software.
     </p>
      <br>

      <h3>5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
      <p>Software should be dependable and adaptable, meaning that it can be altered on demand by the client without any issues. It should operate smoothly and be quick to maintain. To save time and reduce complexity, the data structures should be built correctly, and design patterns should be used when appropriate. Maintaining a software's portability and designing it so that it can be utilized for upcoming projects and updates are both required.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>5.5 Business Rules</h3>
      <p>Users should be able to run software with a variety of individual privileges provided by the system.
        Each function stands alone from the others. Each user's portal needs to be unique based on their rights.
